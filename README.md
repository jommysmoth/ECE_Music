# Music Classification 

Used to keep track of progress on the project code (and papers evantually as well). Major milestone for the whole project right now is...

⋅⋅* Get the first learned results from the real music data


## Data Processing

* Add greater library of music files/clips for dataset
* Convert with convert class
⋅⋅* Speed up code if it takes outrageously long
⋅⋅* Add support for different files if necessary
* Change train/test output if necessary for CNN

## Network Class

* Check speed of training, make deeper/shallower as needed
* Make cleaner (if possible)

## Main File

* Pipe data into network
* Create way to measure time of training
* Create way to measure loss over time
* Clean up when all connected
